# RLC Circuit Simulation

This project simulates a simple **RLC series circuit** using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/). It demonstrates the behavior of an RLC circuit under DC excitation, highlighting transient response and steady-state behavior.

## 🔧 Components Used

| Component         | Value  | Label |
| ----------------- | ------ | ----- |
| Resistor          | 100 Ω  | R1    |
| Inductor          | 10 mH  | L1    |
| Capacitor         | 100 μF | C1    |
| DC Voltage Source | 10 V   | V1    |

## 🧩 Circuit Description

This is a **series RLC circuit** connected to a **DC voltage source**. When the circuit is powered, the inductor initially resists changes in current, and the capacitor charges over time. This simulation helps analyze:

* **Transient behavior** of current and voltage across each component
* **Steady-state response** of the circuit
* Time constants and damping (underdamped, critically damped, or overdamped response depending on values)

## 🔍 Objectives

* Visualize the charging and discharging process of the capacitor.
* Analyze how the inductor opposes the sudden change in current.
* Understand time-domain response in an RLC system.

## 🖼️ Circuit Diagram

> (You can include a screenshot or export of the circuit diagram from CircuitLab here)

## 📊 Simulation Details

* **Software Used:** [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)
* **Type of Simulation:** Transient analysis
* **Duration:** 0 to 0.5 seconds
* **Initial Conditions:**

  * Capacitor initially uncharged
  * Switch closed at t = 0

## ✅ Expected Results

* The current gradually increases as the capacitor charges.
* Voltage across the capacitor rises to match the DC source.
* The inductor causes a delay in the current rise due to its opposition to change (inductive reactance).
* Eventually, the circuit reaches steady-state: the capacitor behaves as an open circuit and the inductor as a short.
